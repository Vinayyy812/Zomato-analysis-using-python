**Zomato Data Analysis**

This repository contains a data analysis project using a Zomato dataset. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain insights into various aspects of the Zomato data.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to clean the Zomato dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and patterns within the data. The analysis includes visualizing various features such as restaurant ratings, votes, types, locations, and costs.

Key Features

Data Cleaning

Handling Missing Values: Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.

Data Transformation: Transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis (e.g., converting rating values to numerical format).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of Ratings: Analyzed and visualized the distribution of restaurant ratings.

Top Restaurant Chains: Identified and visualized the top restaurant chains based on the number of outlets.

Rating vs. Votes: Examined the relationship between restaurant ratings and the number of votes received.

Top and Worst Rated Restaurants: Analyzed the highest and lowest-rated restaurants based on user votes.

Location Analysis: Visualized the distribution of restaurants across different locations.

Cuisine Analysis: Identified and visualized the most popular cuisines.

Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to aid in understanding the data:

Bar Plots: For comparing different categorical features such as restaurant chains, locations, and cuisines.
Distribution Plots: For visualizing the distribution of numerical features like ratings and votes.
Pivot Tables: For summarizing data and identifying trends.
Tools and Libraries
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Seaborn: For making statistical graphics.
