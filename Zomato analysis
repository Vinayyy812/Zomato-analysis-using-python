I have visited this place accidentally with a friend recently. Though the place looks small, it is cozy and a perfect place to have some snacks or to chill out with friends. The prices are reasonable here unlike other places where the items are overpriced and orerrated. The menu is minimalistic and they are very good at what they make. I tried Masala French fries and was stunned by the taste of mayonnaise given with fries. The mayonnaise was absolutely fantastic. Cheers to the chef. I ordered Red velvet waffles tasted very good too. My ratings are 4.5 for this place because I would love to see these people have cheesecakes in their menu.
